# Machacks6_Destination_Doc
Hackathon Project for McHacks 6(Winner of Microsoft challenge:https://devpost.com/software/destination-doc)

## Inspiration
We were inspired to reduce the amount of time it takes to seek medical attention. By directing patients immediately to a doctor specific to their needs, one may reduce the wait time commonly associated with seeking medical aid. 

## What it does
Destination Doc asks a user how they are feeling at which point it determines what type of doctor a patient needs (by screening for flagged words). It then proceeds to search a 10 km radius for establishments that such as dentist offices, walk-in clinics, physiotherapy centers or other need-specific locations. Using Microsoft's Bing's API, Destination Doc determines which destination is the shortest time away using real-time traffic. A map is then displayed directing the user from their home location to the optimal medical center.

## How we built it
We built the application front end using angular and the backend with flask, We incorporated the Cisco merakiI, twilio APIs and azure.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was putting all the different components together as well as doing a lot within a short time constraint.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to take steps in creating a more efficient wait time service and also aiding the cause of better health and being safer.

## What we learned
What we learned - We learned how to leverage the functionality of AngularJs to create a responsive front end page. we also learned how to use HTTP get and post requests to communicate between the front end and the backend network.

## What's next for Destination Doc
We plan to put together destination doc to an extent where anyone can enter their needs and find the best place to get help.
